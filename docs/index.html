      <h1>Quantum Circuit Models: A Primer</h1>
      <h2>What are Quantum Circuits?</h2>
      <p>
        A quantum circuit is a network of wires, where we imagine qubits
        traveling around and going through different quantum gates. To
        understand what this actually looks like, it will be much easier to
        first understand probabilistic circuits
      </p>
      <h2>Probabilistic Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        If you've ever drawn a <i>probability</i> tree, you've also drawn a
        probabilistic circuit!
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/probability_tree.gif"
        style="float: right; width: 350px; margin: 40px"
      />
      <p>
        For example, if you have a biased coin colored blue and red, landing on
        blue \(60\%\) of the time, and red \(40\%\) of the time. We can describe
        the process of flipping this coin twice using the probability tree to
        the right.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We can see how the probability mass progresses through the tree
        (highlighted in green), by multiplying probability mass with the weight
        of each edge it passes over. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say we're going to consider it a "win" if we flip different colors
        in our consecutive tosses. We can then get the overall probability of
        "winning" by adding up all the final probability masses that correspond
        to our win scenario, so in this case \(0.24+0.24 = 0.48\), not too bad
        odds!<br />
      </p>
      <p>Let me show you a circuit that models a coin flip!<br /></p>

      <img src="Assets/prob_hadamard.gif" width="350px" class="center" />
      <p>
        In the gif above, we see a setup that has two inputs and two outputs,
        much like how logic gates take in inputs and outputs on circuits. As you
        might see, this specific gate gives out \(50\%\) to the top and \(50\%\)
        to the bottom, regardless of the input. This coin-flipping gate actually
        has a name: the Hadamard Gate!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I want you to imagine placing two of these in a row so that the
        outputs of the first one map into the input of the next. Stop and
        consider what the output of the second gate should be...
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After some thinking, it feels natural that the output of the second
        Hadamard gate will also be \(50/50\), since every Hadamard gate outputs
        \(50/50\), regardless of input. We could also come to the same
        conclusion by following the possible paths, and adding up the
        probabilities of each path:
      </p>

      <img src="Assets/two_hadamard_prob.png" width="800px" class="center" />

      <p>
        The picture above shows that if you start at the top input, you have a
        \(50\%\) chance to end up at the top output, which makes sense!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we're ready to see how all of this will work when we use quantum
        circuits instead, things are about to get weird.
      </p>

      <h2>Quantum Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        A quantum circuit, is just like a probabilistic circuit, except that the
        edge weights may be complex numbers. Okay, now what does that mean?<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's remake the Hadamard Gate but in the quantum world (<i
          >Notice the complex weights of the top and bottom edges</i
        >).
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/quantum_hadamard.gif" width="800px" class="center" />
      <p>
        So far, not much has changed. We're still letting our probability values
        traverse the network, multiplying with the weight of each edge as we go.
        Actually, we should call our probability values "probability amplitudes"
        now, because they can be complex or even negative, and they don't need
        to add up to \(1\) anymore. This doesn't make sense for normal
        probabilities. In the very end, we do a special operation \(|x|^2\) on
        our probability amplitudes to get rid of negatives and complex values,
        the result is our unnormalized probability. In the example above, we see
        that the final unnormalized probabilities are equal to each other, which
        is the same result we got in our Hadamard gate before, a \(50/50\)
        outcome if we started at the top input!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, notice that we've labeled the top input with a \(0\) and the
        bottom one with a \(1\), we can now treat them as bits of input where we
        either input a \(1\) or a \(0\). In the probabilistic world, we start at
        a single point, with the entire probability mass, letting it spread out
        to the different possible outcomes. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the quantum world, we input a qubit and get out a qubit! In the gif
        above, it looks like we have two different inputs and two different
        outputs, but really we're inputting a single qubit (that happens to have
        a \(100\%\) probability to collapse to a \(0\) if we were to observe
        it), and outputting a single qubit (that now has a \(50\%\) chance to
        collapse to a \(0\), and a \(50\%\) chance to collapse to a \(1\), if we
        observe it). We've put our single qubit into a
        <b>superposition</b>!<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now let's think, if I connect two of these quantum Hadamard gates in
        series such that the probability amplitudes (the values before we do
        \(|x|^2\)) of \(0\) and \(1\), get inputted into the second Hadamard
        gate. If I plug in a \(0\) (a qubit that is \(100\%\) at \(0\)), what's
        the probability that I will end up at \(0\) again? (technically, the
        final qubit's probability for \(0\))
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/hadamard_gates_series.png"
        width="1000px"
        class="center"
      />
      <p>
        Here is when things get funky. We can get the overall probability
        amplitude of a single path by multiplying all the weights of the edges,
        and then performing our operation \(|x|^2\).
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the top path, we have \(i/2 \times i/2 = -1/4\), which, if
        we plug into our operation we get \(|-1/4|^2=1/16\).<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the path that goes from 0, then down in the middle, and
        then up to \(0\) again, we have \(1/2 \times 1/2\) = \(1/4\), which, if
        we plug into our operation we get \(|1/4|^2=1/16\). There's a \(1/16\)
        probability amplitude associated with each path individually.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        So overall, there are two different valid paths with non-zero
        probabilities. But if we want to calculate the total unnormalized
        probability of going from \(0\) to \(0\) we need to sum the paths'
        probability amplitudes first and then do \(|x|^2\).
      </p>
      <img
        src="Assets/quantum_interference.png"
        width="1000px"
        class="center"
      />
      <p>
        How absurd! There are two different paths, which each have a non-zero
        probability amplitude, but if we take both into consideration they
        cancel each other out!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <b>quantum interference</b>, just like how waves can interfere
        with each other and cancel out, so can our probability amplitudes. This
        is the core feature that differentiates quantum circuits from
        probabilistic ones.<br />

        Remove all but \(1\) of the qubits, then set the system up like the
        pictures below and observe how the histogram on the bottom changes.

      <h2>Benefits (over classical models)</h2>
      <p>
        The question now is, what benefits do these quantum circuit models
        provide? Why not just use our classical models of computation?
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of computability, there is actually no difference between the
        two computational models, as any problems that can be solved with
        quantum models can also be solved with classical computation models
        <b>given enough time</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key phrase, however, is “given enough time.” Many computational
        problems that exist today, even though theoretically solvable by our
        classical models of computation, are practically impossible to solve,
        because they require so much time to complete that they do not make
        sense to even attempt!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where quantum circuit models can come into play. They have the
        potential to solve such complicated problems with exponentially fewer
        computational steps than the best-known non-quantum algorithms! This
        capability, known as
        <b>quantum supremacy</b>, is a result of the principles of quantum
        superposition and entanglement, which would, in theory, allow quantum
        computers to explore multiple computational paths simultaneously, a
        property that classical computational models have not been able to
        exhibit.
      </p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        There has been some preliminary progress in quantum algorithms that
        provide some significant time benefits over classical models. One common
        algorithm is
        <b>Shor’s algorithm</b>. The best-known classical algorithm for integer
        factorization requires super-polynomial time. However, with the quantum
        benefits of Shor’s algorithm, this can be completed in polynomial time,
        representing a significant time reduction from classical algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example is <b>Grover’s algorithm</b>, for finding marked
        elements in an unstructured database. For a database with \(N\)
        elements, a linear search would normally take \(O(N)\) time. Grover’s
        algorithm requires just \(O(\sqrt{N})\) time, providing a quadratic
        speedup for the problem, especially for larger database sizes.
        <br />
        An example circuit implementing the algorithm is shown below, using just
        two qubits to search through four possible states .
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/grover.png" width="800px" class="center" />
      <p>
        These quantum algorithms show the compelling potential to revolutionize
        the field of computational theory.
      </p>

      <h2>P = NP?</h2>
      <p>
        How are these quantum circuit models relevant to the ongoing \(P = NP\)
        debate? The debate questions whether the set of \(P\) problems -
        problems that can be solved in polynomial time; relatively quickly - is
        equal to the set of \(NP\) problems - problems that can be verified in
        polynomial time, but can take longer (possibly exponentially longer)
        time to solve. In other words, can all those tough \(NP\) problems be
        cracked just as quickly as the relatively easier \(P\) problems?
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum computing doesn't give us a straightforward answer to this
        question, but it does shake things up. While classical computers might
        struggle with \(NP\) problems, quantum computers could potentially zip
        through them (thanks to their unique abilities of superposition and
        entanglement!).
      </p>
      <p>
        This raises the intriguing possibility of \(NP\) problems being
        polynomial-time solvable on quantum computers, blurring the line between
        \(P\) and \(NP\). The implications of this would be profound, as it
        could revolutionize industries reliant on computational efficiency (such
        as transportation and resource allocation), but could also have adverse
        effects on existing industries reliant on the difficulty of solving
        certain problems, such as blockchain technologies and cryptography.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion: Embracing the Quantum Future</h2>
      <p>
        We've seen some mind-blowing possibilities and jaw-dropping theories of
        quantum circuit models, as well as all other concepts in the field of
        quantum computing. However, we've barely scratched the surface! We still
        have a long way to go, and we're far from having super-powered quantum
        computers that can tackle all the complex real-world problems out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with every step, we can get closer to finally unlocking the
        full potential of quantum computing. This journey may lead us down
        unexpected paths, revealing new complexities and challenging our
        understanding. But that's the thrill of exploration! Let's dive deeper
        and push boundaries; who knows what incredible discoveries await?🚀
